    When you are using Hudson for various automations, it's sometimes convenient
    to be able to "parameterize" a build, by requiring a set of user inputs to
    be made available to the build process. For example, you might be setting up
    an on-demand test job, where the user can submit a zip file of the binaries to be tested.

    <p>
    This section configures what parameters your build takes. Parameters are distinguished
    by their names, and so you can have multiple parameters provided that they have different names.

    <p>
    See <a  href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Hudson-ci/Using_Hudson/Parameterized_Builds">the Wiki topic</a>
    for more discussions about this feature.
    <p>
    It's possible to use Project cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/hudson/the-hudson-book/book-hudson.chunked/ch06.html#section-common-job-configurations">
    this document</a>.
