  If your project requires a clean workspace for each build, select this option.
  This will delete all contents inside the workspace folder at the beginning of
  each build. A side-effect of this is that you will end up doing a fresh
  checkout from source control for each build.
  <p>
  It's possible to use Project cascading feature for this property. Please review <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/hudson/the-hudson-book/book-hudson.chunked/ch06.html#section-common-job-configurations">
